"""
Let's generate a graph that shows the numbers of plates received and uploaded by week. Additionally, it
should also display the difference between effective in- and output as a measure of plate backlog. The data
will be obtained from database reports.

I think we're going to need a new dataframe with plates received and uploaded per week (or maybe even per day) and then received -
uploaded for each time point in fourth column. Then plot the whole thing.
