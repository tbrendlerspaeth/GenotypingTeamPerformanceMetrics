Cycle times

Additions:
- Added some printed messages which inform the user on the progress of the data
collection


Changes:
- The script now also obtains plate names from file names in the E-gels folder
where srPCR files are deposited.
- Commented out code which generated boxplots of cycle times by week. We
have much juicier graphs instead now.
- The juice: instead of a boxplot/line graph we now have a scatter plot of cycle times
with rolling averages for mean, median, and upper control limit as rolmean + 2 * rolstd.
The rolling averages are calculated over a window of 7 days in size and require
a minimum of 10 data points for reliability. The decision to insist on 10 data point
minimum inadvertently created a new measure of performance - if less than
10 plate records are detected for a specific window, there's no line on the graph.
I also learned how to customise the spacing on axes using plt.x/yticks with 
numpy ranges for dates and integers. Aesthetics of the graph has also been much
improved with YouTube university and Matplotlib documentation teaching me 
customisation options which goes beyond simply making the lines on the graph
a different colour.




Lead Times

Changes:
- This script also received the same juicy code that was bestowed onto Cycle Times.
Rolling averages and prettier aesthetics are now present here too.
