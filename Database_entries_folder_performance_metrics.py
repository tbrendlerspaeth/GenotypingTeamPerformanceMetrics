"""
Suggestions for improvement, additions, alterations:
*important*
- *Count number of different plate IDs to give some more indication of outputs for both T121 and Transnetyx*
- * Count number of different mice genotyped to give another indication of output beside plates and entries*

- Highlight the most common assay names
- Bring up the top 10 most error prone assay names for each walk.
- ?bring up the top 10 plates with the most errors associated with them?
- Turn the whole thing into a class? Using methods would cut down on repetition? Or maybe just use different functions?
