"""
Suggestions for improvement, additions, alterations:
- Count number of different plate IDs to give some more indication of outputs for both T121 and Transnetyx
- Highlight the most common assay names
- Bring up the top 10 most error prone assay names for each walk.
- ?bring up the top 10 plates with the most errors associated with them?
- Turn the whole thing into a class? Using methods would cut down on repetition? Or maybe just use different functions?
