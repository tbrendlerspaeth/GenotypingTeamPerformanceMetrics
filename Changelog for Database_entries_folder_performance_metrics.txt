Current features:
The script collects data from Excel database uploads in whatever file it is
pointed using a path input by the user. The folliwng information is then
printed:
Total number of database entries
Total number of T121 entries
Total number of Transnetyx entries
Percentage of T121 retests
Percentage of T121 failed
Percentage of Transnetyx retests
Percentage of Transnetyx failed
Additionally, the script also prints out the time started and finished with
collecting the data and generating the dataframes and the time taken.

Fixes:
- Added except statements to fix KeyError crash that occurred if
df_all_entries had no 'Plate Barcode' or 'Plate' columns.
- Addressed a script breakage that would occur when the df_transnetyx 
dataframe was empty by putting the percentage of transnetyx retests and 
failures calculations in an if statement.

Changes:
- Removed a few comments.
- Removed the printing of times started and finished with harvesting entries
and generating the dataframes. (Time taken still remains.)
