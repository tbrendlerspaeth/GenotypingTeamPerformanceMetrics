Current description describing the script's features: "Data is harvested from the genotyping team
drive to determine how long a plate takes to from having a record made to
appearing in the database uploads folder. Returns an Excel spreadsheet with 
columns: plate_id, earliest_record, latest_record, earliest_upload, 
latest_upload."

Changes:
- Removed the script's functionality to generate an Excel file with results.
- Removed the print(df_plate_records) line.

Additions:
- The script now calculates slow (latest upload - earliest record) and fast 
cycle times (earliest upload - earliest record) and adds them to df_final 
rather than letting the user do this in an Excel spreadsheet.
- Some descriptive statistics are now provided using pd.series.describe for slow
and fast cycle times. The percentiles displayed are currently set to .25, .5,
 .75, 0.95.
- Another walk to capture time file created data from a second uploads folder 
was added. The strings that prompt user to input a folder path for these two
walks now refer to '2019' for the first and '2020' for the second input. This
was done to capture more data for the cycle times for plates started towards the end
of 2019 but which have uploads in 2020. This should improve the accuracy of the
boxplots (see below).
- Work in progress: The script generates boxplots for slow cycle times by month
of the year (currently set to 2019).
